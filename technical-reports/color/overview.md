## What

For this specification, we consider a color type design token to be any token whose value represents a color. 

## Why

(why it helps to have a specification for color tokens)

Color tokens allow teams to manage color decisions at scale, streamline product consistency, reduce technical debt, and optimize the software development lifecycle.

The goal is to manage color at scale for a product which at the end would reduce complexity and communicate the value to stakeholders.

* Color Management at scale 
* reduce complexity
* Standardize your product
