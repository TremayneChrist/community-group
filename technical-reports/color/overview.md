Color tokens allow teams to manage color decisions at scale, streamline product consistency, reduce technical debt, and optimize the software development lifecycle.

The goal is to manage color at scale for a product, thereby reducing complexity and communicating the value to stakeholders.

This module describes best practices in regards to naming color tokens, defining color token values, and supporting multiple themes or brands. It also details future plans for the color module and extended value support.
