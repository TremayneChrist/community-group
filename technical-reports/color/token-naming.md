### Token Naming


#### Categorization

There are 3 main categories of design tokens that we will continue to reference in this specification. 


##### Base

Base tokens are the lowest level tokens and typically consist of a name and [hexadecimal](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hex-notation) value pair. 

Example:


```
$color-green-500: #abcabc;
$color-shadow-translucent: #00000088;
```



##### Alias

A design token’s value can be a _reference_ to another token. The same value can have multiple names or aliases.

Example:


```
$color-palette-black: #000000;
$color-text-base: $color-palette-black;
```



##### Component

Component-specific tokens provide design decisions at the component level and improve the separation of concerns in your token architecture.

Example:


```
$color-button-primary: $color-brand-primary;
$color-banner-background: $color-palette-black;
```



#### Naming Strategies

There are many naming options when it comes to design tokens, especially color type tokens. We’ve identified two that seem to be most commonly implemented, **descriptive and numerical**.


##### Base Tokens

 

For **Base tokens**, here’s how they may be represented in each version: 


###### Descriptive

Descriptive names can be more emotional and human-friendly because they often relate to tangible things that people interact with, like grass or watermelons.


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Pros</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Cons</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Easier for people to identify with, could be used to distinguish Brand colors from product colors
   </td>
   <td>Harder to determine the scale of colors (i.e. which ones are lighter vs. darker, and how they pair well together)
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Example:


```
$color-grass: #abcabc;
$color-brand-watermelon: #;
```



###### Numerical

**Ordered Scales**

Numerical tokens often follow a scale to help delineate how the colors progress. For example, when using an ordered scale, $color-blue-500 may be the base color, where the lightest color value is $color-blue-100, and the darkest value could be $color-blue-900, and these values are ordered in increments of 100s in between. We recommend not using sequential numbers (ex: 1, 2, 3, 4) for scalability in case future colors need to be added in between two existing colors. 

Example:


```
$color-green-400: #____;
$color-green-500: #268e6c;
$color-green-600: #12805c;
```


Numerical token names can also allow for further specificity when needed. For example, when creating neutral palette tokens (like grays), the scale may increase by increments of 25 instead of 100 at the lightest values, and then increment by 100 thereafter. 

Example:


```
$color-gray-25:  #268e6c;
$color-gray-50:  #12805c;
$color-gray-75:  #12805c;
$color-gray-100: #12805c;
$color-gray-200: #_____;
```


**Bounded Scales **

Numerical tokens can also be named through** bounded scales**. These tokens utilize a distinguishing value based on the actual color used for the token, such as in HSL’s lightness value to vary shades of a tint. 

Example:


```
$color-gray-22:  #268e6c;
$color-gray-49:  #12805c;
$color-gray-73:  #12805c;
$color-gray-99: #_____;
```


**Computer Generated Scales**

Token names may also be generated by tools, where the user specifies the base name, and the tool appends scale numbers based on changes to the underlying value.

Example:


```
// User specified name
$color-green

// Tool generated names for 6 steps of opacity 
$color-green-10: rgba(32,178,170, 0.10);
$color-green-20: rgba(32,178,170, 0.20);
$color-green-30: rgba(32,178,170, 0.30);
$color-green-40: rgba(32,178,170, 0.40);
$color-green-50: rgba(32,178,170, 0.50);
$color-green-60: rgba(32,178,170, 0.60);
```



<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Pros</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Cons</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Easy mapping between different tokens for color contrast. For example, all 100-400 tokens pair with 500-900 tokens in order to create accessible color combinations. \
 \
If using bounded scales, the token name can help indicate something about the underlying value 
   </td>
   <td>Less memorable and less obvious difference between tokens
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



##### Alias Tokens 

For **Alias tokens**, we recommend grouping tokens with similar intentions by prioritizing the category + property within the name. For example, all background color Alias tokens would likely start with** $color-background-XXX**.

We recommend avoiding abbreviations. For example, use “background” instead of “bg”, to help with clarity. Some exceptions may be 

<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: undefined internal link (link text: "design system prefixes"). Did you generate a TOC? </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

[design system prefixes](#heading=h.279mf43yevt0). 

Here’s how alias tokens may be represented: 

Example:


```
$color-background-error: $color-red-600;
$color-background-success: $color-green-400;
$color-text-base: $color-palette-black; // Token with variant
$color-text-error-hover: $color-red-700; // Token with variant and state
```


Color alias tokens could also be grouped by concept, like so:

Example:


```
// These can be used for background, border, or text colors
$color-feedback-error: $color-red-600; 
$color-feedback-success: $color-green-400; 
```



##### Component Specific Tokens

Component specific names should start with the component that they support, and be located close to the component code. They commonly refer to alias tokens under the hood, and can be helpful when trying to use consistent styles across components while still maintaining separation of concerns. 

Example:


```
$badge-color-background-error: $color-background-error or $color-feedback-error;
$badge-color-background-success: $color-background-success;
$badge-color-text-error: $color-text-error or $color-feedback-error;
```



#### Supporting Color Modes

Design tokens can be matched with multiple values to support various color modes, like a light mode and dark mode, as an example. This can be implemented in multiple ways, as demonstrated below.


##### Single declaration

In this case, the **$color-text-default** token is defined once, and “value” is considered the default for light mode, and the “darkValue” is used in dark mode.  


```
// tokens/color/alias.json
{
  "color": {
    "text": {
      "default": {
        "value": "#111111",
        "darkValue": "#ffffff",
        "comment": "Default text color"
      }
    }
  }
}
```



##### Multi-file declaration 

In this case, the **$color-text-default** token is defined in two separate files, in different folders. 


```
// tokens/color/alias.json
{
  "color": {
    "text": {
      "default": {
        "value": "#111111",
        "comment": "Default text color"
      }
    }
  }
}
```



```
//tokens/theme/dark/color/alias.json
{
  "color": {
    "text": {
      "default": {
        "value": "#ffffff",
        "comment": "Default text color"
      }
    }
  }
}
```



#### Example of Supporting Multiple Themes and Brands in React


```
// _theme.less

:root {
 --color-interactive: #007c89;
}

:global(.dark-mode) {
 --color-interactive: #133232;
}

// button.less

.primary {
  color-background-primary: var(--color-interactive);
}


```


Theme.js


```
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

export const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
export const SubbrandContext = React.createContext();

const Theme = React.forwardRef(function Theme(
  { theme = 'light', subbrand, children },
  forwardedRef,
) {
  return (
    <SubbrandContext.Provider value={subbrand}>
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
        <div className={cx(subbrand, theme)} ref={forwardedRef}>
          {children}
        </div>
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    </SubbrandContext.Provider>
  );
});


const useThemeContext = () => useContext(ThemeContext);
const useSubbrandContext = () => useContext(SubbrandContext);

export default Theme;
export { useThemeContext, useSubbrandContext };

```


Portal.js


```
import Theme, {
  useThemeContext,
  useSubbrandContext,
} from '@mc/wink/components/Theme';


const Portal = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  const theme = useThemeContext();
  const subbrand = useSubbrandContext();

  return (

        <Theme theme={theme} subbrand={cx(interopContext, subbrand)}>
          {children}
        </Theme>
    </PortalStackContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default Portal;

```


Consumer


```
// subbrand.less

.valentinesDay {
  --color-interactive: #be0000;
  --color-text-base: #313131;

  .dark-mode & {
    --color-interactive: #470000;
    --color-text-base: #cdbfbf;
  }
}

```



```
import {Theme} from "@design-system"

import subbrand from "subbrand.less";

….
return (
  <Theme subbrand={subbrand.valentinesDay}>
    {children}
  </Theme>
)
```
